With this demo, you can now create your own false colour DCTL any way you like. 
Please refer to the images below for the gamma comparison table. I didn't share a version with value for every 0.1 stop calculated 
as that would be too big a table to refer to. If you wish to calculate your own version, feel free to search for the various 
white papers that the respective manufacturer publishes for each gamma.
